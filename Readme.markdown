# NSTimeZone Localization

This project aims to provide localization for the "geopolitical IDs" i.e. region names in the NSTimeZone class. 

These strings files where created by running the knownTimeZoneNames (411 in total) through Google Translate and manually cleaning up inconsistencies. 

Please report any errors you see or contact us if you want to help us add an additional language.
